# What is this?

This is my submission for the GitHub Game Jam in 2022.

The theme of the game jam was Cliche's and I chose "Bull in a China Shop"

I used this project as an opportunity to learn about game development
and the various skillsets that go into it.

Everything in this project has been made by me (and it shows), except
for the font that is used.
